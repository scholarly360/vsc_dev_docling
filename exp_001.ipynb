Notwithstanding the foregoing, both the CONSULTANT and its insurers agree that by naming the COMMISSION as a named insured, the COMMISSION may at its sole direction, but is not obligated to, perform any act required by the named insured under said insurance policies.\n",
      "\n",
      " 7) CONSULTANT shall do all things required to be performed by it pursuant to its insurance policies including but not limited to paying within five (5) work days, all deductibles and self-insured retentions (SIR) required to be paid under any insurance policy that may provide defense or indemnity coverage to COMMISSION or any additional insured.\n",

      "\n",
      " 7. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. CONSULTANT warrants that in the performance of this Agreement, it shall exercise usual and customary professional care in its efforts to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes and ordinances and all lawful orders, rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

The COMMISSION agrees to cooperate and work with the CONSULTANT in an effort to resolve any conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      " 8. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. During and in relation to the performance of this Agreement, CONSULTANT agrees to the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "The CONSULTANT shall not discriminate or permit discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment in any manner prohibited by Federal, State and local laws, including but not limited to race, color, gender, religion, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital status, sexual orientation, age (over 18), veteran status, pregnancy, or any other non-merit factor unrelated to job duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: recruitment; advertising, layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training (including apprenticeship), employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer. The CONSULTANT agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notice setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONSULTANT shall comply fully with all federal, State and local laws and regulations which prohibit discrimination. The CONSULTANT's signature affixed herein, and dated, shall constitute a certification under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the CONSULTANT has, unless exempt, complied with, the nondiscrimination program requirements of Government Code Section 12990 and Title 2, California Administrative Code, Section 8103.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the event of CONSULTANT'S non-compliance with the non-discrimination clauses of this Agreement or with any of the said rules, regulations or orders the COMMISSION may cancel, terminate or suspend the Agreement in whole or in part. CONSULTANT may also be declared ineligible for further agreements with the COMMISSION.\n",
      "\n",
      " 9. HARASSMENT. The COMMISSION maintains a strict policy prohibiting unlawful harassment, including sexual harassment, in any form, including verbal, physical and visual harassment by any employee, supervisor, manager, officer or Board member, or agent of the employer. Vendors, CONSULTANTs, and consultants shall not engage in conduct that has an effect of unreasonably interfering with a COMMISSION employee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.\n",
      "\n",
      " 10. LICENSES. If a license of any kind is required of CONSULTANT, its employees, agents, or sub CONSULTANTs by Federal or State law, CONSULTANT warrants that such license has been obtained, is valid and in good standing, that CONSULTANT shall keep it in effect at all times during the terms of this Agreement, and that any applicable bond has been posted in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      " 11. INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT STATUS . CONSULTANT and COMMISSION have reviewed and considered the principal test and secondary factors herein and agree that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT and not an employee of COMMISSION. CONSULTANT is responsible for all insurance (workers compensation, unemployment, etc.) and all payroll related taxes. CONSULTANT is not entitled to any employee benefits. COMMISSION agrees that CONSULTANT shall have the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein.\n",
      "\n",
      "PRINCIPAL TEST: The CONSULTANT rather than COMMISSION has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for.\n",
      "\n",
      "SECONDARY FACTORS: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise over the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a specialist without supervision, rather than under the direction of an employer; (d) The skill required in the particular occupation is substantial rather than slight; (e) The CONSULTANT rather than the COMMISSION supplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place; (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is engaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the job rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather than part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are creating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship; and (j) The COMMISSION conducts public business.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent CONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT.\n",
      "\n",
      "By their signatures to this Agreement, each of the undersigned certifies that it is his or her considered judgment that the CONSULTANT engaged under this Agreement is in fact an independent CONSULTANT.\n",

      "State universities and community college retirees and employees face increasing threats to their pension and health benefits. The State of Illinois continues to face a structural deficit problem. The govemor's recent push to sell the lottery system for an estimaled $10 billion is clear evidence of the problem.  Rumors suggest that SURS will see yet a third year of underfunding.\n",
      "\n",
      "SUAA took action several years ago t0 address challenges to the current system of funding your pensions commonly referred to as defined benefits plans . Aftler several years of preparation SUAA created SUAACTION a political involvement committee to becorne politically active. In the past it was possible to successfully advocate legislatively through lobbying: This is no longer the case since politics in Illinois has become a pay to play game.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these challenges to both active and retired SURS members , SUAA in 2005 established SUAACTION SUAACTION will serve as the political advocacy arm of SUAA Through SUAACTION, SUAA will maintain a permanent political presence in Springfield in addition to lobbying in the tradilional manner. If successful our move will send a clear signal to those wanting to continue to underfund your retirement system and reduce or eliminate hard earned benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "SUAACTION will focus its activities in four major areas: (1) securing full funding for SURS in accordance with the 1995 pension law and oppose all efforts to further erode our pension benefits; (2) promoting the highest ethical and professional standards in the management of SURS assets; (3) preserving the health benefits we now enjoy; (4) expanding efforts to eliminate Social Secunty penalties, the Windtall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO)\n",
      "\n",
      "The SUAACTIDN political advocacy program will be expensive; and dues cannot be used for political purposes since SUAA is a non-profit; bi-partisan organization: SUAACTION has recommended that its activities be financed by voluntary contributions. Will you volunteer?\n",
